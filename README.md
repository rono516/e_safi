This is a mobile application developed to ease waste management by providing a platform to tenants and/or caretakers to monitor waste using IOT (Internet of Things) for constant awareness around them and to then make decisions based on the information available. The platform also onboards collectors who can 'Start Collection' to alert users (tenants/caretakers or other collectors of their routes and date of collection to enable them map their routes in advance.
Some of the functionalities for the users include;

## Tenants/Caretakers:
+ Sign-up

+ Register for collection
+ Monitor their waste in bins
+ Initiate collection based on data from IOT sensors
+ Check and view collectors and their routes of collection, contacts
+ Initiate a collection request with any collector real-time and view their requests
+ Initiate payments using M-pesa while making their requests
+ Manage their profile


## Collectors
+ Sign-up
+ Login
+ Start Collection and provide routes and contacts to the users
+ View requests from the users and view payment details/ information
